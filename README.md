Seat Finder Application

This application helps you find the location of your seat in the train coach and it also tells you which type of seat it.

Methodology:-

1. Building the UI - For building the seats UI I have created special Widgets specifically 'seatUpWidget' and 'seatDownWidget'.
Combining those 2 widget a new stateless widget 'seatsWidget' is build to create a compartment.

2. The seatsWidget is used in listview to build the coach.

3. A text-field is used to get number input from user and the 'find' button is pressed to find the seat.

The app automatically scrolls to the location of the seat. 

Instructions to run the code:-

To run the code you need flutter sdk and dart sdk installed in your device with an IDE like Android Studio or VSCode.

1. Copy the code link from github.
2. Clone the github repository through Version control option in Android Studio/VSCode.
3. Connect an android device or install an emulator to install the application.
4. Click run. The application will get installed and run on the android device.
